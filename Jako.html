<center> <div> <p> This recipe is so good, my Russian Grandmother [I can not say her name for legal reasons], has been making this cake for as long as I can remember. I love my [INSERT GRANDMOTHER NAME HERE] so much, she's the kindest person I've ever communicated with. Some backstory about me: My name is Kate Mclaughlin. I was born in Changchun, China. I was left in front of a store when two boys found me while playing soccer and gave me to the police. I got abandoned in front of the store due to multiple reasons. I was born a girl, my parents were probably poor, and I had a cleft lip and palate. I happened to get found in a red blanket at just a few days old with a few yuan [according to the orphanage]. I was adopted two years later because my mom saw my photo on the adoption agency website. I live in a two-story house with my mom, dad, and two brothers. I have five siblings, me not included, and I love each of them a lot! My parents both had very rough upbringings; I can tell that theyâ€™re trying their best to provide us with the best quality of life. Two of my strengths are having the ability to strike up a conversation with anyone and ask questions. My two weaknesses are being unable to remain quiet and finding motivation for boring projects. Enough about me though! Lets get to that ding-dang-bing-bong Jako cake recipe!
